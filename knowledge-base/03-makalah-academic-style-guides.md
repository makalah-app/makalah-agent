# Makalah's Academic Writing Style Guides {#makalah-academic-style-guides-root}

This Knowledge Base (KB) document contains all defined style guides and policies for generating academic content within the Makalahs Framework. It is designed to mimic human writing characteristics and ensure academic rigor, serving as the authoritative source for academic writing standards.

Adherence to these guidelines is strictly mandatory for all academic content generation Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

> Segment-ID: MCASG-CORE-STYLE
> Source-File: makalah-academic-style-guides.txt
> Parent-Anchor: {#makalah-academic-style-guides-root}

## Core Academic Writing Style {#makalah-style-core-definition}

This document serves as the final core guide defining the foundational academic writing style for the Makalahs Framework. Its purpose is to produce text that mimics human writing characteristics, aiming to avoid AI detection. Agents are required to adhere to these core rules unless specifically overridden by section-specific style guides. This section links to the root document: `makalah-academic-style-guides#makalah-academic-style-guides-root`.

> Segment-ID: MCASG-CORE-STYLE-WRITING-APPROACH
> Source-File: makalah-academic-style-guides.txt
> Parent-Anchor: {#makalah-style-core-definition}

## 1. Writing Approach: Inductive Narrative {#writing-approach-inductive-narrative}

This approach, combined with other style rules, helps create a less predictable, more human-like structure, specifically for anti-AI detection purposes. The primary writing style mandated is an **inductive narrative**.

The text flow must feature a gradual unfolding of ideas. Generated academic text must primarily follow an inductive narrative style. This means starting with specific observations or context and gradually building towards broader statements or conclusions within sections. Avoid deductive pronouncements at the beginning of paragraphs unless justified.

A formal and objective tone must be maintained throughout all generated academic content. This segment adheres to compliant token usage and ensures resolvable anchor IDs. It links to the core academic style rules at `{#core-academic-style-rules}`.

> Source-File: makalah-academic-style-guides.txt
> Parent-Anchor: {#makalah-style-core-definition}

## 2. Sentence Structure Variation {#sentence-structure-variation}

These rules, prioritizing medium and short sentences, limiting long ones, and requiring the inclusion of short sentences, are specifically designed to break patterns commonly generated by AI models. They aim to mimic natural human writing variation, supporting anti-AI detection efforts. This policy mandates active sentence structure variation with a randomized mix. The distribution should prioritize medium and short sentences while reducing the use of long sentences.

Sentence length must vary actively within paragraphs, avoiding sequences of similarly lengthened sentences. Mix short, medium, and rarely, long sentences unpredictably.
*   **Medium Sentences:** Maximum of 7 words, 1 clause, no complex-compound structures.
*   **Short Sentences:** Maximum of 4 words, 1 clause, no complex-compound structures.
*   **Long Sentences:** Maximum of 12 words, 1 clause, used rarely, no complex-compound structures.

Prioritize medium (5-7 words) and short (2-4 words) sentences. Long sentences (8-12 words) should be used rarely and are limited to one clause, never being complex-compound. Each paragraph must contain at least one, but no more than two, short sentences for emphasis.

Compound sentences are allowed only for simple examples or explanations, using basic conjunctions (e.g., "dan," "atau," "tetapi"). Complex-compound sentences are strictly forbidden. This segment adheres to compliant token usage and ensures resolvable anchor IDs. It links to the core academic style rules at `{#core-academic-style-rules}`.

## 3. Language and Clarity {#language-and-clarity-rules}

Academic output must be in formal Indonesian (`ID-FORMAL`). A high level of clarity must be enforced through simple sentence construction. Prioritize clarity by using straightforward sentence constructions and avoid overly complex or convoluted phrasing.

Avoid unnecessary technical jargon unless it is a defined or standard term. Standard terms should be used where needed, especially English terms as per the English Term Policy (`makalah-academic-style-guides#english-term-policy`). However, complex concepts should be explained simply if required by context, though excessive definition is forbidden. This segment adheres to compliant token usage and ensures resolvable anchor IDs. It links to the core academic style rules at `{#core-academic-style-rules}` and the English term policy at `{#english-term-policy}`.

> Source-File: makalah-academic-style-guides.txt
> Parent-Anchor: {#makalah-style-core-definition}

## 4. English Term Policy {#english-term-policy}

English terms are required for scientific, academic, and technical concepts. Standard scientific, academic, or technical terms commonly used in English must be used directly in English within the Indonesian text. Do not translate these standard terms into Indonesian equivalents unless a widely accepted and unambiguous Indonesian term exists and is contextually appropriate.

Consistency in English term usage must be maintained. This segment adheres to compliant token usage and ensures resolvable anchor IDs. It links to the language and clarity rules at `{#language-and-clarity-rules}`.

## 5. Forbidden Elements (Core) {#forbidden-elements-core}

These words, phrases, and structural elements are strictly forbidden because they are often overused by AI models or contribute to a non-human writing pattern, making text more susceptible to AI detection. This policy defines core forbidden elements. The following elements are strictly forbidden in generated academic output:

*   **Words Forbidden:**
    *   `Mungkin` (perhaps/maybe) when expressing opinions or certainty.
    *   `Tergantung` (it depends) when providing options or conditions.
    *   `Ini` (this) at the start of a sentence. (Replacement: Use `tersebut` or `itu`).
    *   `Bahwa` (that) as an unnecessary copula.
    *   `Adalah` (is/are) as an unnecessary copula, if the sentence can be rephrased.
    *   `Dimana` (where) as a relative conjunction linking clauses.
*   **Phrases Forbidden:**
    *   `Penelitian ini` (this research) at the start of the text.
    *   `Tidak hanya... namun/tetapi juga...` (not only... but also...).
    *   **Extensive list of generic connective/transitional phrases:** `meski demikian` (however), `maka dari itu` (therefore), `oleh karena itu` (therefore), `karena itu` (therefore), `akibatnya` (consequently), `dengan demikian` (thus), `sebagai hasilnya` (as a result), `lebih lanjut` (furthermore), `selain itu` (besides/in addition), `terutama` (especially), `namun` (however/but), `yang lebih penting lagi` (more importantly), `kesimpulannya` (in conclusion), `singkatnya` (in short), `pada akhirnya` (eventually/in the end), `secara keseluruhan` (overall), `intinya` (in essence), `sebaliknya` (conversely/on the other hand), `di sisi lain` (on the other hand), `akan tetapi` (however/but), `walaupun begitu` (even so/nevertheless), `pertama-tama` (firstly), `selanjutnya` (next/furthermore), `di kemudian waktu` (later on), `setelah itu` (after that).

`Tersebut` should be used as the primary demonstrative pronoun. Nested prepositions should be simplified to maintain simplicity in preposition usage. This segment adheres to compliant token usage and ensures resolvable anchor IDs. It links to the core academic style rules at `{#core-academic-style-rules}`.

> Parent-Anchor: {#makalah-style-core-definition}

## 6. Redundancy Prohibition {#redundancy-prohibition}

Avoiding repetition is a characteristic of skilled human writing that helps make text less predictable and patterned, thus supporting anti-AI detection goals. Repetition of words, phrases, or ideas within the same paragraph or across closely related sections is forbidden.

Writing must be concise. Redundant content must be actively eliminated. This segment adheres to compliant token usage and ensures resolvable anchor IDs. It links to the core academic style rules at `{#core-academic-style-rules}`.

Maximum conciseness is required; every word must count, and the shortest possible phrasing should be used. Include essential information only, covering core elements: problem, objective, a gist of the method, key results, and the main conclusion.

Strict internal guidance on length is as follows:
*   **Problem Statement:** 1 sentence.
*   **Methodology Summary:** Maximum 2 sentences.
*   **Key Findings:** Maximum 3 sentences.
