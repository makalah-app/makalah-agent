## 1. Introduction and Purpose {#msam-introduction}

This document defines the policies and conceptual mechanisms for agent memory and session management within the `Agent-Makalah` system. Effective management of memory and session state is critical for supporting the system's complex, iterative workflows, enabling contextual understanding across multiple turns and sub-agent interactions, and ensuring a coherent and productive user experience, particularly during the multi-step process of academic paper creation and analysis.

The primary purpose of this policy is to outline how `Agent-Makalah`, as specified in `spec-agent-makalah-multi-agent`, will handle various forms of data related to user sessions, conversation history, intermediate work products (artifacts), and overall task progression, ensuring robust context handling and memory management. This includes considerations for both short-term (working) memory used during active processing and long-term (persistent) storage required for maintaining context across interactions and enabling features like revision loops. This document will also detail context degradation detection and recovery strategies as they pertain to maintaining a viable working memory for the agents.

## 2. Core Concepts {#msam-core-concepts}

To ensure a common understanding, this section defines key concepts related to memory and session management as they apply to the `Agent-Makalah` system.

**2.1. Session (`User Session`)** {#msam-session-definition}
*   **Definition:** A `Session` represents a complete, coherent period of interaction between a single user and the `Agent-Makalah` system, typically initiated when the user starts a new task (e.g., "create new paper," "analyze my paper") and concluding when the primary task is completed, explicitly terminated by the user, or timed out due to inactivity.
*   **ADK Mapping:** This concept will map directly to the `Session` construct within the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), which provides mechanisms for managing session-specific data.
*   **Characteristics:** Each session will be uniquely identifiable (see Section 4.2. Session ID) and will encapsulate all related interactions, states, and intermediate artifacts produced during that period.

**2.2. Agent State (`Sub-Agent State` & `Orchestrator State`)** {#msam-agent-state}
*   **Definition:** `Agent State` refers to the specific set of data variables and status indicators that define the current condition or progress of an individual sub-agent or the `Orchestrator_Agent` concerning an ongoing task within a session.
*   **Examples for Sub-Agents:**
    *   `Literature_Search_Agent`: Current search queries, retrieved (but not yet validated) references, status of database access.
    *   `Writer_Agent`: The current section being drafted, version of the draft, list of references used for that section.
    *   `Analysis_Editor_Agent`: The document being analyzed, current analysis criteria, intermediate findings.
*   **Examples for `Orchestrator_Agent`:** The current step in the active SOP (e.g., `SOP-AM-001`), status of sub-agent tasks (pending, in-progress, completed, failed), user validation status for intermediate artifacts, revision counts.
*   **ADK Mapping:** `Agent State` will be managed using ADK's `State` persistence capabilities, associated with the current ADK `Session`. This allows state to be maintained across multiple turns or agent invocations within the same overall user session.

**2.3. Conversation Context (`Interaction Context`)** {#msam-conversation-context}
*   **Definition:** `Conversation Context` comprises the relevant sequence of user inputs and `Orchestrator_Agent` outputs (dialogue turns) that have occurred within the current session. This history is crucial for the `Orchestrator_Agent` to understand user intent, maintain coherent dialogue, and make informed decisions.
*   **Content:** Includes timestamps, speaker (user/agent), raw text of messages, and potentially metadata about the interaction (e.g., V-Codes if an error message was presented).
*   **Purpose:** Essential for features like clarifying user intent (`SOP-AM-003`), managing revision loops, and providing context for error recovery.

**2.4. Working Memory (Short-Term Context for LLM)** {#msam-working-memory}
*   **Definition:** `Working Memory` refers to the immediate, short-term contextual information that an LLM (powering any of the `Agent-Makalah` sub-agents) actively uses during a single processing turn or for executing a narrowly defined sub-task. This is typically constrained by the LLM's token limit, requiring careful management to ensure the most relevant information for the current operation is active.
*   **Content:** May include the most recent turns of conversation, the specific task brief from the `Orchestrator_Agent`, relevant segments of an outline or reference list for the `Writer_Agent`, or a chunk of text being analyzed by the `Analysis_Editor_Agent`.
*   **Management:** Strategies will be needed (see Section 5) to ensure this working memory is populated with the most relevant information for the current operation without exceeding token limits.

**2.5. Persistent Storage (Long-Term Context & Artifacts)** {#msam-persistent-storage}
*   **Definition:** `Persistent Storage` refers to the system's capability to store session-related data beyond a single interaction turn or even beyond the active lifespan of an LLM process, allowing it to be retrieved later within the same user session or for auditing.
*   **Content:** Includes the full `Conversation Context`, `Agent State` (especially for the `Orchestrator_Agent` tracking overall progress), and intermediate artifacts like validated topics, reference lists, outlines, and drafted sections.
*   **Mechanism:** This will rely on databases or other persistent storage solutions, governed by the system's overall data handling policies and implemented via ADK's state management or custom storage integrations as defined in `database-design-agent-makalah`.

## 3. Data Persistence Strategy for Iterative Processes {#msam-persistence-strategy}

To effectively support the iterative nature of academic writing and analysis, where users frequently review, provide feedback, and request revisions on intermediate outputs, `Agent-Makalah` must implement a robust data persistence strategy. This ensures that context, progress, and artifacts are not lost between interaction turns or sub-agent activations. The specific storage mechanisms and retention periods for this data are detailed in `database-design-agent-makalah` and `backend-architecture-agent-makalah`, while the types of data requiring persistence are outlined here. This strategy is also informed by the system's overall data security and privacy considerations.

**3.1. Persistence of User Inputs and Agent Outputs (Conversation History)** {#msam-persist-user-io}
*   **Data to Persist:**
    *   **Timestamp:** Date and time of each interaction turn.
    *   **Session ID:** The unique identifier for the current user session.
    *   **User ID:** Identifier for the user (if applicable in the broader system).
    *   **Speaker:** Indication of whether the message originated from the "User" or an "Agent" (specifically the `Orchestrator_Agent` as the user-facing entity).
    *   **Raw User Input:** The exact text or data provided by the user.
    *   **Processed/Clarified User Intent:** The user's intent after clarification by the `Orchestrator_Agent` (e.g., using `SOP-AM-003`).
    *   **Agent Output:** The exact text or structured data presented to the user by the `Orchestrator_Agent`.
    *   **Error Information:** If an agent output was an error message, relevant details such as V-Code and P-level (as defined in `sop-tools-agent-makalah#sop-am-004-error-classification`) should be associated with that turn.
*   **Storage Locus:** This data, forming the `Conversation Context`, will be stored in a structured, persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
*   **Purpose:** Enables review of interaction history, provides context for ongoing dialogue, supports error analysis, and is crucial for session resume capabilities (if implemented).

**3.2. Persistence of Intermediate Artifacts** {#msam-persist-artifacts}
*   **Definition:** Intermediate artifacts are the significant, validated outputs produced by sub-agents during the paper creation or analysis workflow. These serve as inputs for subsequent steps and are subject to user review and revision.
*   **Key Artifacts to Persist (within a session's scope):**
    *   **Definitive Topic:** The user-validated topic string from the `Brainstorming_Agent` / `Orchestrator_Agent`.
    *   **Validated Reference List:** The structured list of references (metadata, summaries, citations) approved by the user, output by the `Literature_Search_Agent`.
    *   **Validated Outline and Draft Points:** The detailed paper structure and key arguments approved by the user, output by the `Outline_Draft_Agent`.
    *   **Validated Drafted Sections:** Each individual section of the paper (e.g., Abstract, Introduction, Methodology) as written by the `Writer_Agent` and approved by the user.
    *   **Validated Analysis Report:** The report generated by the `Analysis_Editor_Agent` and acknowledged/clarified by the user.
*   **Storage Locus:** These artifacts need to be stored in a way that they are accessible throughout the active user session and can be versioned or updated during revision loops. This will likely involve:
    *   Utilizing ADK's `State` management associated with the current `Session` for active artifacts.
    *   Potentially serializing and storing larger artifacts (like full drafted sections) in a temporary persistent store (e.g., a NoSQL database or even a structured file system if appropriate), governed by the system's data handling policies and detailed in `database-design-agent-makalah`.
*   **Versioning (Conceptual for Iteration):**
    *   During revision loops (e.g., user requests changes to an outline), the system must manage different versions or iterations of an artifact. A simple strategy might be to overwrite with the latest validated version, or, for more complex scenarios (post-MVP), maintain a history of key revisions within the session. The `Orchestrator_Agent` will manage which version is currently "active."
*   **Purpose:** Essential for the iterative workflow, allowing users to approve or request changes to discrete components of the work. Prevents loss of progress if a session is interrupted or a later stage requires re-evaluation of an earlier artifact.

**3.3. Persistence of Task State and Workflow Progress** {#msam-persist-task-state}
*   **Data to Persist:**
    *   **Active SOP:** The UID of the primary SOP currently being executed by the `Orchestrator_Agent` (e.g., `SOP-AM-001`).
    *   **Current SOP Step:** The specific step within the active SOP that is currently in progress or was last completed.
    *   **Sub-Agent Task Status:** For any delegated tasks, the status (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed-awaiting-validation, failed) of the sub-agent responsible.
    *   **Revision Counts:** For artifacts undergoing user validation, the current number of revision iterations.
    *   **Key Decisions/Flags:** User approvals, critical error flags related to the session.
*   **Storage Locus:** This high-level state information will primarily be managed within the `Orchestrator_Agent`'s state, utilizing ADK's `State` persistence mechanisms tied to the `Session`.
*   **Purpose:** Enables the `Orchestrator_Agent` to manage the complex workflow, make decisions about the next steps, enforce revision limits, and potentially support session resume functionality.

## 4. Session Management {#msam-session-management}

Effective session management is crucial for providing a continuous and stateful experience for users interacting with `Agent-Makalah`. This section outlines the key aspects of how user sessions will be initiated, tracked, and terminated, leveraging the capabilities of the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).

**4.1. Session Initiation and Termination** {#msam-session-init-term}
*   **Initiation:**
    *   A new user session with `Agent-Makalah` is initiated when a user starts a distinct interaction or task, typically by sending their first request to the system (e.g., through a web interface or other client application connected to the ADK-based backend).
    *   The `Orchestrator_Agent`, upon receiving this initial contact, will be responsible for establishing a new session context, including generating or obtaining a unique Session ID (see Section 4.2).
    *   Relevant initial state variables (e.g., for `Conversation Context`, `Task State`) will be initialized.
*   **Termination:**
    *   A session can be terminated under the following conditions:
        1.  **Explicit User Action:** The user explicitly logs out or indicates they are finished with the current task/session through a defined interface action.
        2.  **Task Completion:** The primary task for which the session was initiated (e.g., successful creation and delivery of a paper via `SOP-AM-001`, or completion of an analysis via `SOP-AM-002`) is fully completed. The `Orchestrator_Agent` will then perform any necessary cleanup and formally close the session.
        3.  **Session Timeout:** If the user remains inactive for a predefined period (see Section 4.3), the session may be automatically terminated to conserve resources.
        4.  **Critical Unrecoverable Error:** A P1 or P2 level error (as defined in `sop-tools-agent-makalah#sop-am-004-error-classification`) that forces a system halt will also terminate active sessions.
    *   Upon termination, any temporary session-specific data that is not designated for longer-term persistence should be cleared or marked for deletion.

**4.2. Session ID** {#msam-session-id}
*   **Requirement:** Each user session must be associated with a unique Session Identifier (Session ID).
*   **Generation:** The Session ID can be generated by the ADK platform upon session creation or by `Agent-Makalah`'s backend system.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   To link all persisted data (conversation history, agent states, intermediate artifacts) to a specific user interaction period.
    *   To enable tracking and management of concurrent user sessions if the system supports multiple users.
    *   To facilitate session resume capabilities (if implemented post-MVP).
*   **Format:** The format of the Session ID should be robust enough to ensure uniqueness (e.g., UUID).

**4.3. Session Timeout (Handling User Inactivity)** {#msam-session-timeout}
*   **Policy:** A session timeout mechanism may be implemented to automatically terminate sessions after a configurable period of user inactivity.
*   **Default Timeout Period:** A default period (e.g., 30-60 minutes of no user interaction) should be defined. This value should be configurable at the system level.
*   **User Warning (Optional):** Before a session is timed out, a warning message could be presented to the user (if the interface allows for such proactive notifications), giving them an opportunity to continue the session.
*   **Action on Timeout:** Upon timeout, the session is terminated (as per Section 4.1). Any in-progress work that has been persisted up to that point (e.g., validated intermediate artifacts) should be saved if the system aims to support session resume. If session resume is not an MVP feature, then timeout may result in the loss of uncompleted work within that session. This detail must be aligned with the system's data handling policies regarding data from inactive sessions, as described in `database-design-agent-makalah` and `backend-architecture-agent-makalah`.

**4.4. Session Resume (Post-MVP Consideration)** {#msam-session-resume}
*   **Concept:** The ability for a user to continue a previous, unfinished session at a later time, with the system restoring the relevant context, state, and intermediate artifacts.
*   **MVP Status:** Session resume is considered a desirable but potentially post-MVP feature due to its complexity. The MVP design for data persistence (Section 3) should, however, lay a foundation that *could* support session resume in the future by ensuring critical data is durably stored and associated with a Session ID.
*   **Requirements for Resume:** Would involve securely re-authenticating the user (if applicable), retrieving the persisted session data using the Session ID, and rehydrating the state of the `Orchestrator_Agent` and relevant sub-agents to the point where the session was left off.

> Context: Details how Agent-Makalah will leverage Google ADK features for managing operational and conversational context, especially for LLM interactions.

## 5. Context Management within Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) {#msam-context-mgmnt-adk}

Effective context management is paramount for enabling the sub-agents within `Agent-Makalah`, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), to perform their tasks accurately and coherently. This section outlines how ADK's features will be utilized to manage the flow and scope of contextual information.

**5.1. Role of `Orchestrator_Agent` in Context Dissemination:**
The `Orchestrator_Agent` plays a crucial role in ensuring that each sub-agent receives only the necessary and relevant context to perform its specific task. It acts as a gatekeeper and formatter of context.
*   When dispatching a task to a sub-agent (e.g., `Writer_Agent`), the `Orchestrator_Agent` will compile a concise "Task Brief" (as mentioned in its specification in `spec-agent-makalah-multi-agent`). This brief will contain:
    *   The specific instructions for the sub-agent.
    *   Only the essential data artifacts required for that task (e.g., for `Writer_Agent`, only the relevant outline section, its key points, and the directly mapped references, not the entire paper's history or all previously explored topics).
    *   Minimal, relevant conversational history if needed for understanding the immediate goal (e.g., user's specific feedback on a previous draft of that section).

**5.2. Utilizing ADK `State` for Context Passing:**
Google ADK's `State` management capabilities, associated with each `Session`, will be the primary mechanism for passing contextual information between the `Orchestrator_Agent` and other sub-agents, or between different steps in an ADK workflow agent.
*   The `Orchestrator_Agent` will update the ADK `State` with the compiled Task Brief before invoking a sub-agent.
*   The sub-agent will read its required context from this ADK `State`.
*   Upon completion, the sub-agent will write its output back to the ADK `State` for the `Orchestrator_Agent` to retrieve and process.
This ensures that context is explicitly passed and managed within the ADK's framework.

**5.3. Managing LLM Token Limits (Working Memory):**
A key challenge is managing the finite token window of LLMs, which constitutes their `Working Memory` (as defined in Section 2.4).
*   **Selective Context Provision:** As described in 5.1, the `Orchestrator_Agent`'s strategy of providing only task-essential information in the Task Brief is the primary method to keep the input to sub-agent LLMs concise.
*   **Summarization (Potential Strategy):** For very long conversations or extensive background material that a sub-agent might need a gist of, the `Orchestrator_Agent` (or a dedicated summarization capability if developed) might create summaries of prior interactions or lengthy documents. These summaries, rather than the full text, would then be included in the Task Brief. The reliability and necessity of on-the-fly summarization for MVP will be evaluated.
*   **Context Window Monitoring (Conceptual):** While ADK might handle some aspects, the `Orchestrator_Agent`'s logic should be mindful of the approximate size of the context being passed to LLM-powered sub-agents. If a Task Brief is anticipated to be too large, it must be truncated intelligently or summarized.
*   **Explicit Instructions for Context Usage:** The internal prompt for each LLM-powered sub-agent (which is constructed by the `Orchestrator_Agent` as part of the Task Brief or is a static part of the sub-agent's definition) will include explicit instructions on how to use the provided context and a directive to ignore any prior, unprovided context from the same session unless explicitly referenced in the current brief. This helps in preventing context contamination between distinct tasks handled by the same underlying LLM if it's reused across different conceptual sub-agent roles over time (though in a multi-agent ADK setup, each sub-agent is distinct).

**5.4. Clearing/Resetting Context for New Tasks:**
When a sub-agent is invoked for a new, distinct task (even if it's the same sub-agent instance being re-tasked by the `Orchestrator_Agent`), the `Orchestrator_Agent` must ensure that the context provided (via ADK `State` / Task Brief) is fresh and relevant only to the new task, effectively "clearing" or "resetting" the working memory for that specific invocation. ADK's state management should facilitate this by allowing targeted updates to the state components relevant to the next task.

> Source-File: memory-session-agent-makalah
> Parent-Anchor: msam-root
> Context: Addresses how Agent-Makalah will conceptually detect and respond to context degradation or loss during long user sessions.

## 6. Context Degradation and Recovery {#msam-context-degrad-recov-006}

While robust context management (Section 5) and data persistence (Section 3) aim to maintain a coherent operational state, long or complex user sessions can still be susceptible to context degradation or perceived context loss by the LLMs. `Agent-Makalah` must have mechanisms to detect and attempt recovery from such situations.

**6.1. Detection of Potential Context Degradation:**

The `Orchestrator_Agent` will be primarily responsible for monitoring indicators of potential context degradation. Detection is not always precise but can be inferred from:
*   **Repeated User Clarifications:** If the user frequently has to re-state previous information or correct the `Orchestrator_Agent`'s understanding of established facts within the current session, it may indicate context drift.
*   **Inconsistent Agent Behavior:** If the `Orchestrator_Agent` or a sub-agent begins to produce outputs that are logically inconsistent with previously validated information or decisions within the same session.
*   **Failure to Resolve Key Contextual References:** If the `Orchestrator_Agent` repeatedly fails to utilize or seems "unaware" of a critical piece of information that was established and validated earlier in the session (e.g., the definitive topic, key user constraints).
*   **Approaching LLM Token Limits for Orchestrator Dialogue:** While sub-agents receive scoped context, the `Orchestrator_Agent` itself maintains the broader user dialogue. If its own internal LLM's context window for managing this dialogue is nearing its limit, proactive measures might be needed.
*   **User Explicitly Stating Confusion:** If the user directly states that the agent seems confused or has forgotten something.
*   **Error Patterns:** A sudden increase in P6-type errors ("Input/Intent Ambiguity") from the `Orchestrator_Agent`'s internal validation when processing user responses might also signal a degrading understanding of the overall context.

**6.2. Triggering Context Recovery:**

When the `Orchestrator_Agent` detects a high probability of significant context degradation based on the indicators above:
*   It should temporarily suspend the current primary SOP (e.g., `SOP-AM-001`).
*   It must initiate a context recovery procedure. This conceptually aligns with triggering a P3 "Context Loss/Degradation" error (as defined in `sop-tools-agent-makalah#sop-am-004-error-classification`).

**6.3. Context Recovery Procedure:**

The recovery procedure, managed by the `Orchestrator_Agent`, will follow a structured process:
1.  **Inform User:** The `Orchestrator_Agent` will inform the user that it needs to refresh its understanding of the current session's context.
2.  **Present Refresh Request:** It will present a structured request for key contextual information, asking the user to confirm/re-state:
    *   The overall current task/goal.
    *   The last significant user input or instruction.
    *   The last significant agent output they recall.
    *   What they expected the agent to do next.
    *   Any other critical pieces of information the `Orchestrator_Agent` flags as potentially lost or ambiguous (e.g., the finalized topic if that seems to be the point of confusion).
3.  **Receive and Validate User Input:** The user's responses to the refresh request will be received and validated for completeness and clarity (potentially using `SOP-AM-003` for this specific input).
4.  **Reconstruct Context:** The `Orchestrator_Agent` will use the validated user-provided information to rebuild or reinforce its internal understanding of the current session state and objectives. This may involve updating its ADK `State`.
5.  **Attempt to Resume Task:** If context reconstruction is successful, the `Orchestrator_Agent` will attempt to resume the suspended SOP from the point of interruption or a logical restart point.

**6.4. Handling User Refusal or Inability to Refresh Context:**
If the user is unable or unwilling to provide the necessary information for context refresh after a reasonable number of attempts, the `Orchestrator_Agent` may have to:
*   Terminate the current session and task, informing the user that it cannot proceed reliably.
*   Escalate to a more critical error state (e.g., P1/P2 if the system becomes entirely unrecoverable).

**6.5. Proactive Prevention (Post-MVP Consideration):**
While reactive recovery is crucial, future versions (post-MVP) may explore proactive context degradation prevention strategies, such as:
*   Periodic, less intrusive context check-ins with the user during very long sessions.
*   More sophisticated internal monitoring of context health indicators.
*   Advanced context summarization techniques for the `Orchestrator_Agent`'s own dialogue management.

> Context: Highlights key security considerations for the data managed and persisted by Agent-Makalah's memory and session systems.

## 7. Security Considerations for Stored Data {#msam-security-considerations}

The data managed and persisted by `Agent-Makalah`'s memory and session systems, including conversation history, intermediate artifacts (which may contain draft academic work), and user-uploaded files, requires robust security measures to protect its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Specific implementation details for security measures will be guided by the overall system security architecture as outlined in `backend-architecture-agent-makalah` and `database-design-agent-makalah`.

**7.1. Access Control:**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Agents and system components should only have access to the specific data necessary for their designated functions. For example, the `Writer_Agent` should only access the specific outline section and references it's tasked with, not the entire session history unless explicitly required and mediated by the `Orchestrator_Agent`.
*   **Role-Based Access (Conceptual):** Access to persisted data stores (databases, file systems) should be controlled based on the role of the accessing service or agent.
*   **User Authentication/Authorization:** If the system supports multiple users or requires user login, strong authentication and authorization mechanisms must be in place to ensure users can only access their own session data.

**7.2. Data Encryption:**
*   **Encryption at Rest:** All persisted data, especially sensitive user inputs, uploaded files, and potentially confidential draft content, should be encrypted when stored in databases or file systems.
*   **Encryption in Transit:** Data exchanged between the user's client, the `Agent-Makalah` backend (ADK), and any external services (if applicable, though less relevant for core memory/session data) must be encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS).

**7.3. Secure Storage of Artifacts and Uploaded Files:**
*   User-uploaded files and potentially large intermediate artifacts should be stored in a secure, isolated location with strict access controls.
*   Measures should be taken to prevent directory traversal or other exploits that could allow unauthorized access to the file system.
*   Regular security assessments of the storage solution are recommended.

**7.4. Protection Against Data Leakage:**
*   The `Orchestrator_Agent` and all sub-agents must be designed to prevent inadvertent leakage of sensitive session data or user information in their outputs to the user, unless such output is the explicit and intended result of a user's request (e.g., displaying a previously drafted section for validation).
*   Error messages should be carefully crafted to avoid revealing sensitive internal system state or data.

**7.5. Regular Audits and Monitoring:**
*   Audit logs of data access, particularly for sensitive artifacts or session data, should be maintained and regularly reviewed for suspicious activity.

**7.6. Secure Deletion:**
*   When data is deleted (e.g., due to retention policies for uploaded files, or user-initiated deletion if supported), it should be done securely to prevent recovery, as specified by the system's data retention policies, detailed in `database-design-agent-makalah`.

These considerations are foundational and must be integrated into the design and implementation of `Agent-Makalah`'s data handling capabilities.
