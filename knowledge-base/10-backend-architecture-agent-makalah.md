> Context: Provides a conceptual high-level view of Agent-Makalah's backend architecture, detailing main layers and data flows.

## 2. High-Level Architecture View {#baum-high-level-arch}

The `Agent-Makalah` backend architecture is structured into several logical layers, designed to separate concerns, enable scalability, and optimize for the multi-agent paradigm facilitated by Google ADK. At its core, it's a cloud-native, API-driven system.

**2.1. Main Architectural Layers:**

*   **Client Interface Layer:** This is the user-facing component, typically a web-based conversational user interface (UI) or a client application, through which users interact with `Agent-Makalah`. It sends user requests to the backend and displays agent responses.
*   **API Gateway / Backend Application Layer (FastAPI):** This layer acts as the entry point for all client requests. It's built using FastAPI and is responsible for:
    *   Receiving user requests from the Client Interface.
    *   Authentication and basic request validation (MVP).
    *   Routing requests to the appropriate ADK Agent in the layer below.
    *   Managing ADK Sessions for user interactions.
    *   Serving as a proxy between the Client Interface and the ADK Agent Layer.
*   **ADK Agent Layer:** This is the core intelligence and orchestration layer, where all `Agent-Makalah`'s functional logic resides. It consists of:
    *   The `Orchestrator_Agent`: The central controller managing overall workflows and coordinating sub-agents.
    *   Specialized Sub-Agents: `Brainstorming_Agent`, `Literature_Search_Agent`, `Outline_Draft_Agent`, `Writer_Agent`, `Analysis_Editor_Agent`, each performing distinct academic tasks.
    *   These agents are implemented using Google ADK and are deployed as scalable services (e.g., Cloud Run services).
*   **Data Persistence Layer:** This layer is responsible for storing all static and dynamic data required by the system. It includes:
    *   **Relational Database (PostgreSQL/Supabase):** For conversation history, session states, and metadata about artifacts.
    *   **Object Storage (Google Cloud Storage):** For temporary storage of user-uploaded files.
    *   **Caching Layer (Redis/Upstash):** For high-speed temporary data access.
*   **External Services Layer:** This layer represents external APIs and services that `Agent-Makalah` integrates with for specialized functionalities not handled internally. It includes:
    *   Large Language Model (LLM) APIs (Gemini, OpenAI).
    *   Web Search APIs (Serper, Google Search).
*   **Logging & Monitoring Infrastructure:** This cross-cutting layer captures operational metrics, application logs, and error traces from all other layers, enabling observability and troubleshooting.

**2.2. Main Data Flows (High-Level):**

1.  **User Request Flow:** User request (Client) -> Backend API -> ADK Agent Layer (`Orchestrator_Agent`).
2.  **Internal Workflow Delegation:** `Orchestrator_Agent` (ADK Agent Layer) -> Sub-Agents (ADK Agent Layer) via ADK's inter-agent communication. Data passed via `session.state`.
3.  **LLM Interaction:** ADK Agent Layer (Sub-Agents) -> External Services Layer (LLM APIs) -> ADK Agent Layer.
4.  **Tool Interaction:** ADK Agent Layer (Sub-Agents) -> External Services Layer (Web Search APIs) OR Data Persistence Layer (Object Storage for files) OR Internal Tool Services (e.g., `tool-makalah-kb-accessor`, `tool-makalah-python-interpreter` if deployed as separate services).
5.  **Data Persistence:** ADK Agent Layer / Backend API -> Data Persistence Layer (Database, Object Storage, Cache).
6.  **Response Flow:** ADK Agent Layer (`Orchestrator_Agent`) -> Backend API -> Client Interface Layer.
7.  **Observability Data:** All layers -> Logging & Monitoring Infrastructure.

This high-level view provides a conceptual understanding of how the different components of `Agent-Makalah` interact to deliver the system's functionalities. More detailed architectural specifics are provided in Section 3.

## 3. Detailed Component Architecture {#baum-detailed-components}

This section elaborates on the design and responsibilities of each primary component within the `Agent-Makalah` backend architecture, detailing their roles, technologies, and interactions.

### 3.1. Client-Side Interface {#baum-client-interface}

*   **Description:** The Client-Side Interface is the user-facing application that provides the conversational interaction experience for `Agent-Makalah`. It is typically a web-based UI or a client application.
*   **Technology Stack:** Standard web technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript framework like React/Vue/Angular, or a simpler frontend if chosen for MVP) will be used. (Not within the direct scope of backend development, but vital for context.)
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Presenting the conversational chat interface to the user.
    *   Capturing user text inputs and uploading file inputs.
    *   Displaying `Agent-Makalah`'s text responses, structured outputs (e.g., formatted reference lists, outlines), and interactive elements (e.g., validation prompts, revision options).
    *   Providing basic task progress indicators.
    *   Communicating with the Backend API Gateway via secure web protocols.
*   **Interaction:** Communicates with the Backend API Gateway using HTTP/S and WebSockets (for real-time chat updates).

### 3.2. Backend API Gateway & Core Application (FastAPI) {#baum-backend-api}

*   **Description:** This component serves as the primary entry point for all external communications to `Agent-Makalah`'s backend. It's a lightweight, high-performance web application built with FastAPI.
*   **Technology Stack:** FastAPI (Python), deployed as a containerized service (Docker) on a Render Web Service.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   **API Gateway:**
        *   Receiving all incoming requests from the Client-Side Interface (user messages, file uploads, validation responses).
        *   Routing requests to the appropriate internal services, primarily the ADK Agent Layer.
        *   Handling rate limiting and basic request validation (e.g., API key presence for MVP).
    *   **Session Management:**
        *   Initiating and managing ADK `Session` lifecycles for each user interaction.
        *   Maintaining the link between the user's client session and the active ADK `Session`.
    *   **Request Pre-processing:**
        *   Performing initial parsing and validation of user inputs before forwarding to the ADK Agent Layer.
        *   Handling file upload streams and securely storing them to an object storage service (e.g., Cloudinary, AWS S3), then passing the storage reference to the ADK Agent Layer.
    *   **Response Handling:**
        *   Receiving responses and final outputs from the ADK Agent Layer (specifically the `Orchestrator_Agent`).
        *   Formatting responses for client consumption (e.g., converting structured agent output to a displayable JSON format).
        *   Sending responses back to the Client-Side Interface.
    *   **Error Handling:**
        *   Catching and logging API-level errors.
        *   Proxying errors reported by the ADK Agent Layer to the client.
*   **Key API Endpoints (Conceptual):**
    *   `POST /chat`: For submitting user messages and receiving agent responses.
    *   `POST /upload_file`: For users to upload documents for analysis.
    *   `GET /session_status`: (Optional) To query the status of an ongoing session.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Receives requests from Client-Side Interface (HTTPS/WebSockets).
    *   Communicates with the ADK Agent Layer (potentially via internal HTTP calls if ADK Agents are separate Render Services, or direct function calls if co-located).
    *   Interacts with Data Persistence Layer (PostgreSQL, Object Storage, Redis) for session state and data storage.
    *   Sends responses back to Client-Side Interface.
    *   **Scalability:** Leverages Render Services' auto-scaling capabilities (based on configuration) to handle varying loads.

> Source-File: backend-architecture-agent-makalah
> Parent-Anchor: baum-detailed-components
> Context: Details the core ADK Agent Layer, where Agent-Makalah's multi-agent logic and orchestration reside.

### 3.3. ADK Agent Layer {#baum-adk-layer}

*   **Description:** This layer houses the entire multi-agent system of `Agent-Makalah`, built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). It orchestrates the complex workflows, manages state, and interacts with external services (LLMs, web search) and data persistence.
*   **Technology Stack:** Google ADK (Python), Python 3.9+, deployed as containerized services (Docker) on Render Services (e.g., Web Services or Background Workers).
*   **Responsibilities (Overall):**
    *   Executing `Agent-Makalah`'s core functional logic.
    *   Coordinating tasks among specialized sub-agents.
    *   Managing session state and context using ADK's native features.
    *   Integrating with external LLM APIs and other tools.
    *   Handling internal error propagation and coordination.

**3.3.1. `Orchestrator_Agent` Deployment & Role** {#baum-adk-orchestrator-deployment}
    *   **Description:** The `Orchestrator_Agent` serves as the central control and communication hub for the entire `Agent-Makalah` system. It's the primary ADK Agent responsible for directing the workflow based on user intent and managing sub-agent interactions.
    *   **Deployment Model:** Deployed as a dedicated Render Service (e.g., Web Service or Background Worker, or potentially as the main ADK application entry point if other sub-agents are called internally within the same ADK runtime instance on a single Render Service).
    *   **Responsibilities:** As detailed in `spec-agent-makalah-multi-agent` (`Orchestrator_Agent` section) and `sop-tools-agent-makalah` (`SOP-AM-001`, `SOP-AM-002`, `SOP-AM-003`, `SOP-AM-004`, `SOP-AM-005` orchestration steps).
    *   **Interaction:** Receives requests from the Backend API Gateway. Calls and receives responses from other sub-agents. Interacts with the Data Persistence Layer.

**3.3.2. Sub-Agents Deployment & Roles** {#baum-adk-sub-agents-deployment}
    *   **Description:** This includes the specialized `Brainstorming_Agent`, `Literature_Search_Agent`, `Outline_Draft_Agent`, `Writer_Agent`, and `Analysis_Editor_Agent`. Each is designed to perform a distinct, focused task within the overall workflow.
    *   **Deployment Model:**
        *   **Option A (Separate Render Services):** Each sub-agent is deployed as its own distinct Render Service (e.g., Background Worker). This provides maximum isolation and independent scalability.
        *   **Option B (Co-located within `Orchestrator_Agent`'s Runtime):** Sub-agents' ADK `Agent` implementations are part of the `Orchestrator_Agent`'s Render Service. `Orchestrator_Agent` invokes them as internal components/functions. This might simplify initial deployment but ties their scaling to the `Orchestrator_Agent`.
        *   **Recommendation for MVP:** Option B is simpler for initial deployment and MVP, especially if inter-agent communication overhead is minimal. Option A can be a future enhancement for larger scale or strict microservices adherence.
    *   **Responsibilities:** As detailed in `spec-agent-makalah-multi-agent` for each respective sub-agent.
    *   **Interaction:** Primarily interacts with the `Orchestrator_Agent` (receiving commands, returning outputs) and external services/tools (LLMs, search APIs, file storage).

**3.3.3. Inter-Agent Communication within ADK** {#baum-adk-inter-agent-comm}
    *   **Mechanism:** Communication relies heavily on the ADK's `session.state` object for explicit data passing and direct method invocation (or ADK's agent-calling patterns).
    *   **Data Flow:**
        *   **`Orchestrator_Agent` to Sub-Agent (Task Brief):** `Orchestrator_Agent` writes task inputs (Task Brief, relevant artifacts, context subset) to specific `session.state` keys. It then invokes the sub-agent.
        *   **Sub-Agent to `Orchestrator_Agent` (Task Output):** Upon completion, the sub-agent writes its output to a designated `session.state` key and returns a completion signal.
    *   **Payload Format:** Data payloads in `session.state` are structured and JSON-serializable (e.g., Python dictionaries, lists of dictionaries) to ensure interoperability.
    *   **Reference:** `adk-integration-agent-makalah#aim-inter-agent-comm` for conceptual details.

**3.3.4. ADK Workflow Management** {#baum-adk-workflow-mgmt}
    *   **Mechanism:** The `Orchestrator_Agent` will manage the sequential workflows (e.g., New Paper Creation, Existing Paper Analysis) using a hybrid approach within ADK.
        *   The main orchestration logic (user interaction, validation loops, branching) resides within the `Orchestrator_Agent`'s custom Python code (as a `CustomAgent`).
        *   It then programmatically calls specific sub-agents as needed.
        *   ADK's `WorkflowAgent`s (e.g., `SequentialAgent`) *could* be used for managing simpler, internal sequences *within* a sub-agent's local execution logic, but the top-level orchestration remains with `Orchestrator_Agent`.
    *   **Responsibility:** The `Orchestrator_Agent` is responsible for updating `session.state` to reflect workflow progress, manage revision iterations, and track the current step within the active SOP.
    *   **Reference:** `adk-integration-agent-makalah#aim-workflow-orchestration` for conceptual details.

> Source-File: backend-architecture-agent-makalah
> Parent-Anchor: baum-detailed-components
> Context: Details the architecture of Agent-Makalah's data persistence layer, including database, caching, and object storage.

### 3.4. Data Persistence Layer {#baum-data-persistence}

*   **Description:** This layer is responsible for the reliable, persistent storage and retrieval of all data required by the `Agent-Makalah` system. It supports conversation history, session state, intermediate artifacts, user-uploaded files, and operational metadata. It adheres to the data persistence strategy outlined in `memory-session-agent-makalah#msam-persistence-strategy`.
*   **Technology Stack:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase or Render PostgreSQL), Redis (via Upstash or Render Redis), an object storage service (e.g., Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Render Disks for smaller, non-CDN-critical files).

**3.4.1. PostgreSQL Database (Supabase / Render PostgreSQL)** {#baum-postgresql-db}
    *   **Purpose:** The primary relational database for structured, long-term persistent data.
    *   **Managed Service:** Supabase or Render's managed PostgreSQL service can be utilized, simplifying database administration and scaling.
    *   **Key Data Stored:**
        *   **Conversation History:** Full dialogue turns between users and `Orchestrator_Agent`, including timestamps, speaker, raw inputs, and outputs.
        *   **Session Metadata:** Unique Session IDs, session initiation/termination timestamps, associated user IDs.
        *   **Agent State (Persisted):** High-level `Orchestrator_Agent` state information, overall SOP progress, and status of major workflow steps (e.g., "Topic Finalized," "References Validated"). This is a durable copy of critical ADK `session.state` elements.
        *   **Intermediate Artifact Metadata:** References to or metadata about stored intermediate artifacts (e.g., object storage path for a validated outline, ID for a record in a separate artifacts table).
        *   **User Account Information:** Securely hashed credentials, user profiles, API keys (if applicable).
    *   **Data Schema:** As defined in `database-design-agent-makalah`.

**3.4.2. Redis Cache (Upstash / Render Redis)** {#baum-redis-cache}
    *   **Purpose:** For high-speed caching of frequently accessed, ephemeral data (e.g., short-term session data not managed by ADK's core state persistence, rate limiting counters, potentially cached LLM responses if permissible).
    *   **Managed Service:** Upstash (Serverless Redis) or Render's managed Redis service can be used.
    *   **Key Data Cached:**
        *   Active ADK `Session` data (potentially, if ADK's default persistence to DB is too slow for certain hot paths).
        *   Rate limiting counters.
        *   Frequently accessed configuration data.

**3.4.3. Object Storage (Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Render Disks)** {#baum-object-storage}
    *   **Purpose:** For secure and scalable storage of user-uploaded academic paper files (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and potentially large intermediate artifacts generated by agents.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   **External Service (Cloudinary/S3):** Offers robust features, CDN capabilities, and advanced access control. Suitable for larger files and public-facing links if needed.
        *   **Render Disks:** Suitable for persistent storage directly attached to Render services. Good for files that don't require CDN access and can be managed within Render's ecosystem. Might be simpler for MVP if advanced object storage features are not immediately necessary. The choice depends on file size, access patterns, and CDN requirements.
    *   **Metadata:** Metadata about stored objects (e.g., file type, size, user ID, GCS path if an external service is used) will be stored in the PostgreSQL database.

> Source-File: backend-architecture-agent-makalah
> Parent-Anchor: baum-detailed-components
> Context: Details the architecture for integrating Agent-Makalah with external services, including LLM providers and search APIs.

### 3.5. External Service Integrations {#baum-external-integrations}

*   **Description:** This component represents the integration points and mechanisms through which `Agent-Makalah` interacts with third-party external services. These services provide core functionalities (like advanced AI reasoning and comprehensive web search) that are critical to the system but not hosted within `Agent-Makalah`'s direct purview.
*   **Technology Stack:** Python HTTP client libraries (e.g., `httpx`, `requests`), ADK's built-in tool integration, specific service client SDKs.

**3.5.1. Large Language Model (LLM) Providers** {#baum-llm-providers}
    *   **Providers:** Google Gemini API (Primary), OpenAI API (Fallback/Alternative). Specific model versions (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) will be utilized. Access might be mediated through API gateways like OpenRouter for flexibility.
    *   **Integration Point:** Primarily accessed by the LLM-powered ADK Agents (`Orchestrator_Agent`, `Brainstorming_Agent`, `Writer_Agent`, `Analysis_Editor_Agent`) through ADK's native `LlmAgent` constructs. The Backend API Gateway does not directly call LLM APIs for core processing.
    *   **Mechanism:** Agents send structured prompts (text, sometimes structured JSON for function calls) to the LLM APIs and receive JSON responses containing generated text or structured data.
    *   **Security:** API keys and credentials for LLM providers will be managed securely using a secrets management service (e.g., Google Secret Manager) and never hardcoded or exposed in public repositories.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient LLM API errors. Handle specific error codes (e.g., rate limits, invalid requests) according to defined fallback policies.

**3.5.2. Web Search API** {#baum-web-search-api}
    *   **Providers:** Serper API (Primary), Google Search API (Alternative/Fallback).
    *   **Integration Point:** Accessed by `Literature_Search_Agent` and `Brainstorming_Agent` (for specific purposes) via the `tool-makalah-web-search` custom ADK tool.
    *   **Mechanism:** The `tool-makalah-web-search` (as a Python function registered in ADK) will make HTTP requests to the chosen Web Search API with formulated queries.
    *   **Security:** API keys for search providers will be securely managed. All search queries will be sanitized and comply with usage policies.
    *   **Error Handling:** Handle rate limits, API failures, and empty results.

**3.5.3. Custom Tool Services (Internal or External)** {#baum-custom-tools}
    *   **Description:** This category includes tools like `tool-makalah-kb-accessor`, `tool-makalah-browse-files`, and `tool-makalah-python-interpreter`. Their "external" nature here depends on their deployment model.
    *   **Deployment Models:**
        *   **Co-located/Internal:** If implemented as Python functions directly within the ADK Agent's codebase and deployed as part of the same Render Service. Communication is direct function call.
        *   **Separate Microservice:** If a tool (e.g., a more complex `tool-makalah-python-interpreter` with a specialized execution environment, or a `tool-makalah-kb-accessor` that talks to a separate content store) is deployed as its own Render Service. Communication would be via internal HTTP API calls.
    *   **Integration Point:** Accessed by various sub-agents via their respective custom ADK tool definitions.
    *   **Security:** Adherence to sandboxing for `tool-makalah-python-interpreter` and strict access controls for `tool-makalah-browse-files` is critical. Authentication/authorization may be required for calls to separate microservice tools.
    *   **Error Handling:** Tool-specific errors (e.g., sandbox violations, file access errors) are captured and reported back to the calling agent.

> Source-File: backend-architecture-agent-makalah
> Parent-Anchor: baum-detailed-components
> Context: Details the architecture for logging and monitoring across Agent-Makalah components, utilizing GCP services for observability.

### 3.6. Logging & Monitoring Infrastructure {#baum-logging-monitoring}

*   **Description:** This cross-cutting concern ensures that all `Agent-Makalah` components generate adequate logs and metrics for operational visibility, debugging, performance analysis, and security auditing.
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Logging:** Render's built-in log streaming. For more advanced needs, integration with a third-party centralized logging platform (e.g., Sentry, Logtail, Datadog). Python's standard `logging` module will be used within the application code.
    *   **Monitoring:** Render's built-in service metrics (CPU, memory, network, request count, latency). For more detailed application performance monitoring (APM), integration with a third-party APM tool (e.g., Sentry, Datadog, New Relic).
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   **Structured Logging:** All application components (FastAPI backend, ADK Agents) will produce structured logs (e.g., JSON format) containing relevant context (timestamp, service name, request ID, user ID, severity, message).
    *   **Metrics Collection:**
        *   **System Metrics:** Render automatically provides metrics for its services.
        *   **Application Metrics:** Custom metrics (e.g., number of active ADK sessions, tool invocation counts, LLM API call latencies) can be exposed via Prometheus-compatible endpoints if using external monitoring, or logged for later analysis.
    *   **Alerting:** Configure alerts based on critical log patterns (e.g., high error rates) or metric thresholds (e.g., high CPU usage, excessive latency) using Render's capabilities or an integrated third-party service.
    *   **Log Aggregation & Analysis:** Logs from all services will be streamed to Render's logging system or a centralized platform for easy searching, filtering, and analysis.
*   **Key Logged Information:**
    *   Incoming API requests and responses (FastAPI).
    *   ADK Agent invocations, inputs, and outputs.
    *   Tool calls, parameters, and results.
    *   LLM API requests (excluding sensitive data like API keys in logs) and responses (or summaries).
    *   Errors and exceptions with stack traces.
    *   Security-relevant events (e.g., authentication attempts, authorization failures).
*   **Integration with ADK Logging:** ADK's internal logging mechanisms will be configured to align with the overall logging strategy, ensuring that ADK agent logs are also captured and structured appropriately.

**3.6.1. Data Protection at Rest and in Transit**

*   **Data Encryption at Rest:**
    *   **Requirement:** All sensitive data persisted in the Data Persistence Layer (PostgreSQL database for conversation history, session state, artifact metadata; Google Cloud Storage for uploaded files) SHALL be encrypted at rest.
    *   **Mechanism:** Leverage native encryption capabilities provided by managed cloud services (e.g., Render's managed PostgreSQL and Redis encryption, object storage service encryption).
*   **Data Encryption in Transit:**
    *   **Requirement:** All data transmitted between `Agent-Makalah`'s components (Client-Backend API, Backend API-ADK Agent Layer, ADK Agents-Data Persistence Layer, ADK Agents-External Services) SHALL be encrypted.
    *   **Mechanism:** Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all external communication (Client to Backend API). Secure internal channels provided by Render.com for inter-service communication.

**3.6.2. Authentication and Authorization**

*   **API Gateway Authentication (Basic for MVP):**
    *   **Requirement:** The Backend API Gateway (FastAPI) SHALL implement basic authentication for controlling access from the Client Interface (e.g., API keys, simple token validation) for MVP.
    *   **Mechanism:** API keys or static tokens managed securely.

> Source-File: backend-architecture-agent-makalah
> Parent-Anchor: baum-root
> Context: Describes the primary data flows within Agent-Makalah's backend architecture, detailing information movement between components.

## 4. Data Flow Diagrams (Textual Description) {#baum-data-flow}

This section describes the key data flows within the `Agent-Makalah` system, illustrating how information moves between the architectural components. This serves as a textual representation of what would typically be depicted in Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) or sequence diagrams.

**4.1. User Request & Response Flow**

This flow describes the journey of a user's initial request into the system and the eventual delivery of the `Agent-Makalah`'s response.
1.  **User Initiates Request:** User inputs a query (text/file) via the Client Interface.
2.  **Request to Backend API:** Client Interface sends the request (HTTP/S, WebSockets) to the Backend API Gateway (FastAPI).
3.  **Backend API Pre-processing & Session Management:**
    *   FastAPI endpoint receives request, performs initial validation.
    *   Initiates/retrieves ADK `Session` for the user.
    *   If file upload: FastAPI stores file to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and obtains a reference.
4.  **Backend API to ADK Agent Layer:** FastAPI invokes the `Orchestrator_Agent` (an ADK `Agent`), passing the user's request (text/file reference) and relevant session state (via ADK `session.state`).
5.  **ADK Agent Layer Processing (`Orchestrator_Agent`):**
    *   `Orchestrator_Agent` receives the request.
    *   Clarifies user intent (possibly involving `SOP-AM-003` dialogue loop with user via FastAPI).
    *   Orchestrates the main workflow (`SOP-AM-001` or `SOP-AM-002`) by calling various sub-agents.
    *   Manages user validation loops (`SOP-AM-005` dialogue with user via FastAPI).
6.  **Sub-Agent Execution & Interaction:**
    *   `Orchestrator_Agent` writes task-specific inputs to ADK `session.state` (e.g., topic for `Brainstorming_Agent`, outline for `Writer_Agent`).
    *   `Orchestrator_Agent` calls the relevant sub-agent (e.g., `Brainstorming_Agent`, `Literature_Search_Agent`, `Outline_Draft_Agent`, `Writer_Agent`, `Analysis_Editor_Agent`).
    *   Sub-agent performs its task (e.g., calls LLM API, Web Search API, accesses GCS via `tool-makalah-browse-files`, uses `tool-makalah-python-interpreter`).
    *   Sub-agent writes its output (e.g., topic options, reference list, drafted section, analysis report) back to ADK `session.state`.
    *   Sub-agent signals completion to `Orchestrator_Agent`.
7.  **Data Persistence:** Throughout Step 5 & 6, `Orchestrator_Agent` and sub-agents read from/write to Data Persistence Layer (PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for cache, GCS for files) via FastAPI or directly through ADK's storage integrations.
8.  **Error Handling & Logging:** Errors detected at any layer (sub-agent, tool, FastAPI) are propagated to `Orchestrator_Agent`. `Orchestrator_Agent` logs the error and initiates fallback (potentially involving user interaction via FastAPI). All key interactions and errors are logged to Render's logging system.
9.  **Response Generation (`Orchestrator_Agent`):** `Orchestrator_Agent` assembles the final response (e.g., complete paper, analysis report) or specific dialogue turn.
10. **Response to Backend API:** `Orchestrator_Agent` returns the response to the Backend API Gateway.
11. **Backend API to Client:** FastAPI formats the response and sends it back to the Client Interface.
12. **Client Displays Response:** Client Interface displays the response to the user.

**4.2. New Paper Creation Workflow Data Flow (Illustrative)**

This flow specifically illustrates the core data movement for creating a new paper, building upon the `sop-tools-agent-makalah#sop-am-001-root`.

*   **User -> `Orchestrator_Agent`:** Initial request, intent clarifications, topic validations, reference validations, outline validations, section draft validations.
*   **`Orchestrator_Agent` -> `Brainstorming_Agent`:** Initial topic idea, user feedback for refinement.
*   **`Brainstorming_Agent` -> Web Search API (via `tool-makalah-web-search`):** Search queries for inspiration.
*   **Web Search API -> `Brainstorming_Agent`:** Raw search results.
*   **`Orchestrator_Agent` -> `Literature_Search_Agent`:** Definitive topic, search command.
*   **`Literature_Search_Agent` -> Web Search API (via `tool-makalah-web-search`):** Academic search queries.
*   **Web Search API -> `Literature_Search_Agent`:** Raw search results.
*   **`Literature_Search_Agent` -> `Orchestrator_Agent`:** Structured, validated reference list.
*   **`Orchestrator_Agent` -> `Outline_Draft_Agent`:** Definitive topic, validated references, outline creation command.
*   **`Outline_Draft_Agent` -> `Orchestrator_Agent`:** Structured outline, draft key points, reference mapping.
*   **`Orchestrator_Agent` -> `Writer_Agent`:** Outline section, draft key points, relevant references, reference mapping, writing command.
*   **`Writer_Agent` -> `Orchestrator_Agent`:** Drafted paper section, bibliography data for section.
*   **All Agents <-> Data Persistence Layer:** Read/write state, artifacts, history (PostgreSQL, GCS, Redis).
*   **All Agents -> Logging/Monitoring:** Send logs and metrics.

**4.3. Existing Paper Analysis Workflow Data Flow (Illustrative)**

This flow illustrates the core data movement for analyzing an existing paper, building upon the `sop-tools-agent-makalah#sop-am-002-root`.

*   **User -> `Orchestrator_Agent`:** Uploaded paper file, analysis request, analysis criteria.
*   **`Orchestrator_Agent` -> GCS:** Uploaded file stored.
*   **`Orchestrator_Agent` -> `Analysis_Editor_Agent`:** File reference (from GCS), analysis criteria, analysis command.
*   **`Analysis_Editor_Agent` -> GCS (via `tool-makalah-browse-files`):** Read uploaded file content.

> Segment-ID: BAUM-SCALABILITY-RELIABILITY-006
> Source-File: backend-architecture-agent-makalah
> Parent-Anchor: baum-root
> Context: Discusses architectural considerations for ensuring Agent-Makalah's scalability and reliability, leveraging cloud-native features.

## 6. Scalability & Reliability Considerations {#baum-scalability-reliability}

The architecture of `Agent-Makalah` is designed to be inherently scalable and highly reliable, leveraging cloud-native patterns and managed services on Render.com. This is critical for supporting the initial target of 1,000 users and ensuring a stable, performant experience.

**6.1. Scalability Considerations**

*   **Horizontal Scaling for Compute Services:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Core compute components (Backend API Gateway/FastAPI, `Orchestrator_Agent`, and individual sub-agents if deployed as separate Render Services) are deployed on Render Services. Render provides automatic horizontal scaling based on request load, scaling instances up or down (even to zero) as needed.
    *   **Benefit:** This ensures that the system can handle varying user loads efficiently without manual intervention, optimizing cost for fluctuating traffic.
*   **Stateless or Near-Stateless Services:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Backend API Gateway and individual ADK Agents (especially if deployed as separate Render Services) are designed to be largely stateless or near-stateless. Critical session state is externalized to the Data Persistence Layer (PostgreSQL, Redis).
    *   **Benefit:** Enables easy horizontal scaling of compute services as instances can be added or removed without concern for local state.
*   **Database Scalability:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Utilizing managed PostgreSQL (Supabase or Render PostgreSQL) and Redis (Upstash or Render Redis) services allows for scaling these data stores according to the provider's capabilities, often with minimal manual intervention for read replicas or instance upgrades.
*   **LLM Provider Scalability:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Reliance on highly scalable external LLM APIs (Google Gemini API, OpenAI API) which are designed for high throughput.
    *   **Benefit:** Ensures that the core AI capabilities can meet demand as user traffic grows.

**6.2. Reliability Considerations**

*   **Managed Services:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Extensive use of Render's managed services (Web Services, Background Workers, PostgreSQL, Redis) reduces operational complexity and leverages Render's built-in reliability, redundancy, and maintenance.
    *   **Benefit:** Higher availability and reduced mean time to recovery (MTTR) compared to self-managed infrastructure.
*   **Redundancy and High Availability:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Render Services inherently offer high availability by distributing instances. Managed databases and Redis services typically provide built-in data redundancy and replication.
    *   **Benefit:** Protects against single points of failure at the infrastructure level.
*   **Robust Error Handling & Fallbacks:**
    *   **Mechanism:** The multi-agent architecture incorporates a comprehensive error handling strategy (`sop-tools-agent-makalah#sop-am-004-root`), ensuring graceful degradation, recovery attempts, and clear communication to the user during failures.
    *   **Benefit:** Improves user experience by preventing abrupt crashes and guiding users through issues.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Integrated monitoring and logging (Render's monitoring system) provide real-time visibility into system health, performance bottlenecks, and errors. Proactive alerts notify operations teams of critical issues.
    *   **Benefit:** Enables rapid detection and resolution of operational problems, minimizing downtime.
*   **Idempotent Operations (Where Applicable):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Design critical API endpoints and internal agent operations to be idempotent where feasible. This ensures that repeated requests (e.g., due to network retries) do not result in unintended side effects.
    *   **Benefit:** Improves reliability in distributed systems.

**7.1. Version Control:**
*   **Repository:** All source code (FastAPI backend, ADK agents), Dockerfiles, infrastructure-as-code definitions (if any, e.g., Render Blueprint YAML), and deployment configurations will be stored in a centralized Git repository (e.g., GitHub).

**7.2. Continuous Integration (CI):**
*   **Trigger:** CI pipeline will be triggered on every push to main branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`) or on pull requests.
*   **Platform:** GitHub Actions is the primary CI platform.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Code Checkout:** Fetch the latest code from the Git repository.
    *   **Dependency Installation:** Install Python dependencies.
    *   **Linting & Static Analysis:** Run linters (e.g., Flake8, Pylint) and static analysis tools (e.g., MyPy) to ensure code quality.
    *   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Execute automated tests to validate code correctness and component interactions.
    *   **Docker Image Build:** Build Docker images for the FastAPI backend and ADK agent services.
    *   **Push to Registry (Optional but Recommended):** Push the built Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry). Render can also build from a Dockerfile directly from the Git repo.

**7.3. Continuous Deployment (CD):**
*   **Trigger:** CD pipeline can be triggered automatically after a successful CI build on specific branches (e.g., `main` for production) or manually for controlled releases.
*   **Platform:** Render's native Git integration or Docker deployment capabilities.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Deployment to Render:** Render will automatically pull the latest code (if deploying from Git) or the specified Docker image from the registry and deploy it to the configured Render Services (Web Services, Background Workers).
    *   **Database Migrations (if applicable):** Any database schema changes should be handled through a managed migration process, potentially triggered as part of the deployment or as a separate step.
    *   **Health Checks:** Render performs health checks to ensure the new deployment is operational before switching traffic.
    *   **Zero-Downtime Deployments:** Render typically supports zero-downtime deployments for web services.

**7.4. Environment Management:**
*   **Mechanism:** Separate Render services or distinct configurations within Render will be maintained for different environments (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`).
*   **Configuration:** Environment-specific configurations (API keys, database URLs, LLM endpoints) will be managed using Render's environment variable groups and secrets management.

**7.5. Rollback Strategy:**
*   **Mechanism:** Render's deployment history allows for quick rollbacks to previous stable versions in case of deployment issues. Automated rollback based on health check failures can also be configured.

**7.6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Render Blueprints (Optional but Recommended):**
*   **Mechanism:** Define Render services, databases, Redis instances, and their configurations using a `render.yaml` blueprint file stored in the Git repository. This allows for version-controlled, repeatable, and automated provisioning of the entire infrastructure on Render.

**7.7. Monitoring and Alerting Post-Deployment:**
*   **Mechanism:** As detailed in Section 3.6, Render's monitoring system will be fully utilized post-deployment for continuous operational visibility.
*   **Practice:** Dashboards will be set up to visualize key metrics, and alerts will be configured for critical events (e.g., high error rates, downtime, resource spikes).
*   **Benefit:** Enables proactive issue detection and rapid response.

> Source-File: backend-architecture-agent-makalah
> Parent-Anchor: baum-root
> Context: Outlines potential future architectural enhancements for Agent-Makalah beyond the MVP.

## 8. Future Architectural Enhancements (Post-MVP) {#baum-future-enhancements}

The initial backend architecture for `Agent-Makalah` focuses on robustness and scalability for the MVP. However, the long-term vision includes several architectural enhancements to support increased complexity, higher scale, and new features (as outlined in `prd-agent-makalah#prd-future-considerations`).

**8.1. Microservices Decomposition & Granularization:**
*   **Enhancement:** Further decompose the ADK Agent Layer into more granular microservices. For instance, `Writer_Agent`'s various internal functions (e.g., citation integration, style correction) could become specialized microservices. Similarly, complex tools might evolve into dedicated services.
*   **Benefit:** Enhanced independent scalability, fault isolation, and specialized teams for highly specific components.

**8.2. Advanced Inter-Service Communication:**
*   **Enhancement:** Introduce robust asynchronous communication patterns between services.
*   **Mechanism:** Implement message queues or event streaming platforms (e.g., Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Apache Kafka) for decoupled communication between FastAPI backend, ADK Agents, and data processing pipelines.
*   **Benefit:** Improved responsiveness, resilience to transient failures, and scalability by processing tasks asynchronously.

**8.3. Knowledge Graph & Vector Database Integration:**
*   **Enhancement:** Implement a dedicated Knowledge Graph database and integrate it with a Vector Database.
*   **Mechanism:** Store rich, interconnected academic concepts, entities, and relationships in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB). Store vector embeddings of academic content and KB snippets in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus).
*   **Benefit:** Enables advanced semantic search, contextual understanding, and powers features like the Knowledge Graph Visualization (as per `prd-agent-makalah#prd-future-considerations`). This allows agents to reason over interconnected data more effectively.

**8.4. Real-time Data Processing & Analytics:**
*   **Enhancement:** Introduce real-time data processing capabilities for conversational analytics or immediate feedback loops.
*   **Mechanism:** Utilize stream processing technologies (e.g., Google Cloud Dataflow, Apache Flink) for analyzing live interaction data.
*   **Benefit:** Enables deeper insights into user behavior and potential for dynamic system adjustments.

**8.5. Enhanced Security & Compliance Features:**
*   **Enhancement:** Implement more sophisticated security controls like fine-grained access control policies for specific data attributes, advanced threat detection, and automated compliance auditing.
*   **Mechanism:** Integrate with specialized security services and tools (e.g., vulnerability scanners for Docker images, or services like Snyk if deeper security analysis is needed beyond Render's capabilities).

**8.6. Hybrid Cloud/Multi-Cloud Strategy (If Needed):**
*   **Enhancement:** Explore deploying specific workloads or data to other cloud providers or on-premises environments.
*   **Benefit:** Diversifies infrastructure, potentially optimizes costs, or addresses specific regulatory requirements. (High complexity, usually for very large-scale systems).

This roadmap will be prioritized based on product evolution, user needs, and technological advancements post-MVP.
